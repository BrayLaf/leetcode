# Daily LeetCode Progress

Tracking my journey through daily LeetCode problems.

## Problems Completed

### Day 1 Two Sum
Simple at first glance, but once I started aiming for better time complexity, it became more challenging than expected. Learned a good amount about hash maps through this problem.

### Day 2 Add Two Numbers
Sounds simple in theory. This one taught me more about linked lists... still not my favourite data structure, but getting more comfortable with them.

### Day 3 Longest Substring Without Repeating Characters
Felt very confident going into this one. I was aiming for an O(n) solution from the start and managed to get there using some fairly simple concepts. Used a sliding window with the last index tracking for a pretty clean solution.

### Day 4 Merge Sorted Array
A fairly simple one, not sure why but not returning an array and just editing array 1 one to be the result kinda got me at the end. It was a super simple fix but I just kept overlooking it.

### Day 5 Remove Element
Admittedly a very simple one but solving this one felt really smooth and I enjoyed the process.

# Daily LeetCode Progress

Tracking my journey through daily LeetCode problems.

## Problems Completed

### Two Sum
Simple at first glance, but once I started aiming for better time complexity, it became more challenging than expected. Learned a good amount about hash maps through this problem.

### Add Two Numbers
Sounds simple in theory. This one taught me more about linked lists... still not my favourite data structure, but getting more comfortable with them.

### Longest Substring Without Repeating Characters
Felt very confident going into this one. I was aiming for an O(n) solution from the start and managed to get there using some fairly simple concepts. Used a sliding window with the last index tracking for a pretty clean solution.

# Daily LeetCode Progress

Tracking my journey through daily LeetCode problems.

## Problems Completed

### Day 1 Two Sum
Simple at first glance, but once I started aiming for better time complexity, it became more challenging than expected. Learned a good amount about hash maps through this problem.

### Day 2 Add Two Numbers
Sounds simple in theory. This one taught me more about linked lists... still not my favourite data structure, but getting more comfortable with them.

### Day 3 Longest Substring Without Repeating Characters
Felt very confident going into this one. I was aiming for an O(n) solution from the start and managed to get there using some fairly simple concepts. Used a sliding window with the last index tracking for a pretty clean solution.

### Day 4 Merge Sorted Array
A fairly simple one, not sure why but not returning an array and just editing array 1 one to be the result kinda got me at the end. It was a super simple fix but I just kept overlooking it.

### Day 5 Remove Element
Admittedly a very simple one but solving this one felt really smooth and I enjoyed the process.


### Day 6 Remove Duplicates from Sorted Array

The use of Read/Write indexes here was super fun to implement, hopefully will use them again in the future.

### Day 7 Remove Duplicates from Sorted Array 2

Took the wrong approach to this one at first trying to use a window and writing to the middle value if all 3 were equal, realized I was going about it wrong and went back to the solution for the first Remove duplicates. Used a similar Read/Write approach for this one.

### Day 8 Majority Element

Super simple at first glance, tried with a hashmap approach at first and was able to complete it with that approach but it was O(n) space due to the worst case of every element in the array being unique. Went with a very simple count with a ternary expression that will add or decrease the count ultimately leading to the majority element being found.
